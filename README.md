Task Description
The Rentomojo Assignment involves creating a commenting system similar to Instagram. The main functionalities of the commenting system are as follows:

 this app Store the number of likes and dislikes for each comment.
I build a simple signup and login page for user authentication.
In this Users cannot like/dislike their own comments.
In this Users cannot like/dislike a comment more than once.
Users can post nested comments as replies to existing comments.
Nested comments can also be liked or disliked by other users.
Implement pagination to allow users to view up to 10 comments per page.
Ensure smooth application loading with pagination.
Project Components
Frontend (SPA)
The frontend will be developed as a Single Page Application (SPA) using a chosen frontend 
framework (e.g., Reactjs). The frontend will provide a user-friendly interface 
for users to interact with the commenting system. Users can view comments, post new comments, like/dislike comments, and view nested comments.

Backend (Node.js)
The backend is developed using Node.js, providing the necessary API endpoints to handle user
authentication and the commenting system functionalities. It will be responsible for storing and retrieving
comment data, managing likes and dislikes, and handling user authentication.

Database
I have  choosen MongoDB to store comment data and user authentication details.
